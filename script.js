No radioactive waste is created as a byproduct of nuclear energy production and nuclear power plant accidents are prevented. Perhaps for your future environmental policies, you might wish to consider the issue of climate justice and the possibility of implementing government schemes which compensate victims of the negative health effects of nuclear testing in the past.",

You have taken an important step towards the abolishment of nuclear weapons, minimising environmental damage from nuclear testing and the future threat of nuclear winter. Your decision to advocate for the production of nuclear energy also somewhat helped the process of shifting away from the use of fossil fuels. However, since you decided to implement nuclear energy without extensive regulation, toxic radioactive waste from its production has now become a pressing environmental concern along with the possibility of nuclear power plant accidents.",

Thanks to implementing an extensive regulation scheme around the production of nuclear energy, you do not have to be too worried about the risk of accidents and can manage radioactive waste more productively.

Although your advocacy of nuclear energy helped the process of shifting away from the use of fossil fuels, it also led to the production of radioactive waste and the risk of environmentally destructive accidents.
